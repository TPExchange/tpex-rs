# TPEx Rust code

This repo is split into two parts.

In the [tpex-api](./tpex-api/) folder, you will find the code for interfacing with TPEx, both from the client and server side. If you are developing a program to interact with TPEx, this is almost certainly what you want.

In the [tpex](./tpex/) folder, you will find the business logic for TPEx. Even with the `tpex-api` library, this is how you will be inspecting the TPEx state.
